This folder contains the AI replacement for the Pokedex. I built this AI replacement as the final project for the Data Analytics course at Syracuse University. 

  - The written report is contained in the "AI Pok√©mon Scanner Pipeline" file and should be read for a detailed description of what I did and how I did it.
  - The PowerPoint presentation is in the file "Real Time Pokemon Stat Classification" and can be used as a high-level overview.
  - The "FinalProjectCode.ipynb" file contains the code I used to get these results.
