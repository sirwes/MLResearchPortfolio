This repository contains data science projects completed during my M.S. in Data Science at Syracuse University as a part of the Portfolio Milestone. In it contains my professional resume, a paper demonstrating how I've achieved the learning goals of the ADS program, project deliverables, and a video presentation to summarize it all.
All information under the folder "Others" are not a part of the milestone, but are included in this repository because they are related.
