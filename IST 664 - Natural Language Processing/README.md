This folder contains my comparison and implementation of two different Natural Language Generation algorithms. Namely Markov Chains and GPT-2. I did this as the final project for the NLP course at Syracuse University.

  - The written report is contained in the "Natural Language Generation Analysis" file and should be read for a detailed description of what I did and how I did it.
  - The code for the Markov Chains is in the "MarkovChainCode.py" file and the code used for GPT-2 is in the "GPT2 Code - Colaboratory" file and can be used on Google Colaboratory.
